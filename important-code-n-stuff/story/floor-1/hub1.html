            <p>Directly across from the entrance there seems to be a <a href="floor-1-staircase.html">staircase</a>. A <a>door on your left</a> is labelled <scribbles->bed room</scribbles->, and another <a href="pnrm.html">door to your right</a> is labelled <scribbles->potion room</scribbles->.</p>
