            <p>It took you a while to make sense of this map. It's labelled in some sort of code or language you've never encountered before, and only vaguely resembles the surrounding landscape. But now you can see that the wonky circle labelled <scribbles->great throne room</scribbles->, must be the Great Throne Room, that ancient hollowed mountain. That would make the long straight line labelled <scribbles->swift water river</scribbles-> the Swift Water River, and <scribbles->blue river</scribbles->, the squiggly line intersecting it, must be the Blue River.</p>
            <p>You should take a moment to translate those words. Hover over the orange word to bring up the translation window, and type in what you think it must mean. <!-- If you're not sure, don't worry - you can take notes and change your translation any time. And if you're really stuck, you can find the correct translation with a flash of insight. But your insight is limited, so use it sparingly.</p> -->
